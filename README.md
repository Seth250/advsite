## Assessment


### Running with Docker
- If you have docker installed, you can run the application by either:
  - Running the quickstart script `source scripts/docker-quickstart.sh`
  - Manually creating `.env` using `.env.example` and running `docker compose up --build` (this is what the quickstart script does automatically)
